## ðŸ”§ Task Requirements

1. **Backend (Node.js):**
    - Set up a Node.js project with the necessary dependencies (`express`, `axios`, `cheerio`, etc.).
    - Write a script using `axios` to fetch the contents of the Amazon search results page for a given keyword.
    - Use `cheerio` to parse the HTML content and extract the following details for each product listing on the first page:
        - Product Title
        - Rating (stars out of five)
        - Number of reviews
        - Product image URL
    - Create an endpoint `/api/scrape` where a GET request with a query parameter `?keyword=yourKeyword` initiates the scraping process and returns the extracted data in JSON format.
2. **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
    - Develop a simple webpage with:
        - An input field to enter the search keyword.
        - A button to initiate the scraping process.
    - Style the webpage to be user-friendly and presentable.
    - Implement JavaScript to make an AJAX call to the backend endpoint when the button is clicked, and display the results formatted cleanly on the page.

**Documentation:**

-   Provide comments within your code to offer clarity on your logic and process.
-   Include a [README.md](http://readme.md/) file with the setup and running instructions.

**Submission:**

-   Push your code to a GitHub repository and ensure it is accessible publicly.
-   Provide the link to the repository for evaluation.

**Considerations:**

-   Ensure you handle errors gracefully both on the backend and frontend.
-   Do not attempt to circumvent any of Amazon's scraping protections or Terms of Service.
-   Provide clear instructions on how to run the application.

## Project Development ðŸ’¡

The project construction was divided into three stages. Initially, I dedicated time to fully comprehend what was being proposed. After this phase, I sought information by exploring documentation and videos to gain a better understanding of the proposed model.

The implementation posed challenges, especially because most of the documentation focused on bringing results to the console when accessing the Amazon site. Nevertheless, I persisted in the development, progressing to the practical part of the project.

In the third stage, I applied my logic to devise how the results would be returned to the web page after the user entered the product's name.
